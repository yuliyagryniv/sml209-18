The flag of France (French: Drapeau français) is a tricolour flag featuring three vertical bands coloured blue (hoist side), white, and red. It is known to English speakers as the French Tricolour or simply the Tricolour (French: Tricolore). The Tricolour has become one of the most influential flags in history, with its three-colour scheme being copied by many other nations, both in Europe and the rest of the world

My three top definitions:
<dl>
  <dt>preposition</dt>
  <dd>A word like "at", "to", "in", "over" etc. Prepositions usually come before a noun and give information about things like time, place and direction.</dd>
  <dt>tense</dt>
  <dd>The form of a verb that shows us when the action or state happens (past, present or future). Note that the name of a tense is not always a guide to when the action happens. The "present continuous tense", for example, can be used to talk about the present or the future.</dd>
  <dt>modal verb</dt>
  <dd>An auxiliary verb like can, may, must etc that modifies the main verb and expresses possibility, probability etc. It is also called "modal auxiliary verb".</dd>
