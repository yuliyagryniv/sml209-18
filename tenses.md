<h1>Tenses & Verb Conjugations</h1>

<p> This page will primarily focus on three tenses and their conjugations of the main French verbs including the auxiliary Avoir and ÃŠtre. </p>

<h1>The Present Tense</h1>

<p>The Present tense is used:

<ul>
  <li>to describe what is happening now. 
    i.e. <i>I am reading this book</i> </li>
  <li>o describe what usually happens. 
    i.e. <i>I read a book every day</i> </li>
</ul>  

<p>There is only one present tense in French: Je mange          <i>I eat</i> or <i>I am eating<i> </p>
  
<p>To use a verb in the present tense, you must change the infinitive according to a set of rules. You need to learn these rules by heart.
  There are three types of regular verbs: <b>-er</b> verbs, <b>-ir</b> verbs and <b>-re</b> verbs.
  <b>-er</b> verbs are the most common type.
